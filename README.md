# despot
**d**raumaz's **e**lastic **s**ightless **p**ackage-**o**fficiation **t**ool.

## why did you make this?
- installing and managing source-based packages on debian sucks.

## pkg/repo
- <a href="https://github.com/draumaz/despot/tree/main/pkg/repo">a disappointingly small collection of build scripts</a>.

## install
- ```git clone https://github.com/draumaz/despot```
- ```cd despot; chmod +x despot```

## tracking projects
- ```cd pkg/src```
- ```git clone https://github.com/blahblah/coolrepo```

## contributors
- <a href="https://github.com/DeltaDove">DeltaDove</a> - project name

## CURRENT ISSUES
- Scripts have to constantly request superuser permissions during install.
