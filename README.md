# despot
**d**raumaz's **e**lastic **s**ightless **p**ackage-**o**fficiation **t**ool.

- i switched to debian in april 2022, and despite enjoying it a lot, i noticed a lot of tiny packages i need were missing from the repositories.
- i started building packages manually, until i started automating the process, where despot was born.
